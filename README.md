## Logging

Logging in our project is written to files in the `logs` directory. The log files are named based on the date they were created. 
The log files are plain text files and can be opened with any text editor, and a new log file is created each day. 
Within the log files, the log files name is the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.log`, the log contents have the
following format:

```
[<timestamp>] (source/loglevel) [log id] log message
```

> Optionally if the log message from an error, the stack trace will be printed below the log message.

##### Example
```
[2:51:27:659] (GET /api/config) [e214d157-cf66-4cef-9707-0f3f0be4a60f] Unauthorized user 'test' attempted to access the config.
```
